This web application allows you to track your workouts by recording your location, distance, time, and other metrics using the browser's built-in geolocation and local storage APIs. You can create a new workout by selecting the type of activity (running or cycling), entering the workout details, and clicking on the map to set the starting and ending points of your workout.
